As the program is written in collaboratory, it is important that the preferences files are uploaded to the workspace. I set up a github repository so that they could easily be read in. Also the files will be written to the workspace, not the repository, so they can be viewed in collaboratory or downloaded. 

I have created 4 additional .txt files which test other edge cases and optimal solutions for those are provided as well. Lists 0-4 are the originals however. 

If using collaboratory just select Runtime > Run all which will read in the files and generate the solution.
