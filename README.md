I highly recommend using collaboratory to run this notebook. I set up a github repository so that the preference files could easily be read in. Also the solution files will be written to the workspace, not the repository, so they can be viewed in collaboratory or downloaded. They are also turned in to the drop box.

I have created 4 additional preference.txt files which test other edge cases and optimal solutions for those are provided as well. Lists 0-4 are the originals.
