I highly recommend using collaboratory to run this notebook. I set up a github repository so that the preference files could easily be read in. Also the solution files will be written to the workspace, not the repository, so they can be viewed in collaboratory or downloaded. They are also turned in to the drop box. An easily readable version of the solution is provided as the code output as well as facts baout each group and the number of preferences satisfied compared to the random baseline.

I have created 4 additional preference.txt files which test other edge cases and optimal solutions for those are provided as well. Lists 0-4 are the originals. 

Once the notebook is open, unhide the cells and go to runtime > run all. Solution outputs will be printed under the last cell.
